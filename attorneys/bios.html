        <h3>Bob Ring</h3>
          <p class="personal-title"><em>Founder</em></p>
        <hr>
              <p class="text-left bio-text">Bob Ring graduated from the University of Wyoming with a political science degree, and the University of Wyoming College of Law with a Juris Doctorate Degree. From Law School, he joined the John Hoyman Law office, a small firm in Greeley. He assisted the firm in winning more money for their clients than any other in Northern Colorado: by consistently handling cases efficiently, and by exceeding the standards set by the community. </p>
                <p class="text-left bio-text">As their practice grew, Bob and John amicably divided their Northern Colorado market in 1999, and Bob has carried that same level of compassion and expertise - inspiring his own firm to be the largest workers’ compensation firm in Larimer County. As his career flourishes, he remains focused on representing clients in Workers' Compensation and injury related cases. Bob finds passion for getting clients the justice they deserve - every client receives a level of personal attention uncommon in firms of this caliber.</p>
          <p class="text-left bio-text">
              Bob lives in Northern Colorado with his wife and five children and is an active member of the Colorado Trial Lawyers Association (CTLA). The Ring Family loves the welcoming Northern Colorado community and enjoys taking advantage of all that Colorado has to offer.
